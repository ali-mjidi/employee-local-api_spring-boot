# Employee API

A simple RESTful API for managing employees using Spring Boot, MySQL, and Spring Security.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Spring Boot  
- Spring Data JPA  
- Spring Security (Basic Auth, JDBC-based)  
- Spring Data REST (optional)  
- MySQL  

## üîê Authentication

Uses **JDBC-based authentication**.  
Users and roles are stored in the database (`users` and `authorities` tables).

## üìÅ Setup

1. Create a `.env` file:

```env
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_directory
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

2. Make sure the MySQL database `employee_directory` exists and has the correct schema.

3. Run the application:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
